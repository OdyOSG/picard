\description{
The baseline covariates are used to create the summary table 1 of our analysis. Further
we can assess baseline comorbidities for our population of interest. This function
creates a feather file for each set of baseline covariates: demographics, conditions, drugs, cohorts,
and continuous covariates. Conditions are extracted based on condition group eras with
a 365 day look back period. We also create condition summaries based on
icd chapters. The ICD chapter rollup is used for the table 1 in the written report. The drugs
are created based on a 365 day look back period and the features are based on drug era groups.
The cohort covariates are a set of pre-defined cohorts that have been loaded to the cohort table. See
the input/cohorts_to_create folder for the covariate cohorts. Continuous covariates are those that
must be summarized using min, max, median and IQR. This includes age, time of observation and DSCI.
Each type of baseline covariate is saved as a feather file in the output/baseline folder. We can
also include a strata for the baseline covariates. The saving convention is automated based on the
strata used.
