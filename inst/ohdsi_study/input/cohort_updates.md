Directions for Tracking file 

This file is suppose to help organize and track the development of cohort definitions over the course of a project. Everytime a cohort json file is added to the cohorts_to_create folder, the user should update the cohort_updates.md file describing the json that was added or annotate any changes to existing files. We provide an example in the start-up folder.
