</h2>
<p>The <code>picard</code> package was developed following observation
of the <a href="https://ohdsi.org/sos-challenge/" class="external-link">2023 SOS Challenge</a>
which aimed at improving and communicating the process of developing
effective OHDSI studies. While following the <a href="https://ohdsi.org/sos-challenge/" class="external-link">2023 SOS Challenge</a>, we
noticed there were several bits of documentation that were vital for an
OHDSI study. Study leads needed to provide ample information to their
nodes via the ohdsi studies github to run the study. We noticed that
several of these tasks had repeating patterns, that we felt could be
automated. We also noticed how heterogenous the structure of an OHDSI
study could be when looking at the <a href="https://github.com/ohdsi-studies" class="external-link">ohdsi-studies</a> github
repository. While some <a href="https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/StudyRepoTemplate" class="external-link">guidance</a>
was provided, repositories did not seem to cohere to any specific
development process.</p>
<p>Based on our study development experience, we also felt strongly
about having strong organization in order for a study to be effective.
Code and study materials need to be effectively communicated and easily
accessible for study members to understand and appreciate the complexity
of developing a timely and effective study. Basic organizational
methods, made it easier to track mistakes and fix cohort definitions as
studies improve via scientific collaboration. These experiences and our
observations of the SOS challenge lead to the development of the
<code>picard</code> package. The <code>picard</code> package attempts to
provide a development workflow for OHDSI studies by automating
repeatable tasks and providing consistent organization to make study
repositories effective sources of guidance for communicating the science
behind a study and executing the software to generate evidence. The
<code>picard</code> package is heavily inspired by the <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/" class="external-link"><code>usethis</code> package</a> that
is used to assist in the development workflow of novel R packages and
projects alike. Similar to the development of an R package, there are
several steps and pieces of documentation needed in an OHDSI study to
effectively run the study across the OHDSI network. We felt that the
OHDSI community could benefit from a bit of software the provided
assistance towards the development of a study. These studies could be
privately ran studies within institutions or multi-stakeholder OHDSI
network studies. In this document we provide a roadmap for existing
development and future features we wish to add to the
<code>picard</code> package.</p>

<h2 id="mission">Mission<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mission"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>picard</code> package is a workflow tool that assists in
the development of OHDSI studies. This would host a series of functions
intended to assist in both the development (tools for the study host)
and execution (tools for the study node) of studies. <code>picard</code>
intends to streamline OHDSI studies to conform to a known structure and
standard making it easier to communicate, execute and develop
studies.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="strategus">Strategus<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#strategus"></a>
</h3>
<p>Over the past year, there has been significant development on <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/Strategus" class="external-link">strategus</a> a tool that
helps coordinate and execute HADES modules. Strategus has a significant
impact on OHDSI studies since it has modularized a OHDSI study
execution. It is vital that <code>picard</code> is developed in a way
that enhances the strategus experience. We intend to provide functions
that aim to support the strategus paradigm for OHDSI studies. Alignment
between these packages we believe will improve the user experience for
study developers and study nodes alike. An area of potential development
would be functions to support the development of strategus modules.</p>

<h3 id="templates-makefile">Templates (<code>make{File}</code>)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#templates-makefile"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first suite of functions is intended to auto-start pre-rendered
files that are needed for an OHDSI study. The <code>picard</code>
package stores multiple templates that are written with <a href="https://github.com/edwindj/whisker" class="external-link">whisker</a> used for logicless
templating. The whisker function places a {{{ Mustache }}} in the file
that is rendered with specified inputs. These inputs are largely filled
out by the <code>_study.yml</code> file which serves as a meta data
object for the OHDSI study. This construction is equivalent to that of
the <code>usethis</code> package, however the files are oriented
specifically for OHDSI studies. Below is a list of files currently
covered by templates in <code>picard</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>**_study.yml**: a meta file for the study providing key information
for other templates</li>
<li>
<strong>README.md</strong>: a cover-page providing a basic
description and information about the study</li>
<li>
<strong>NEWS.md</strong>: a versioning file that tracks changes to
the study overall, depicting the development of the study overall</li>
<li>
<strong>config.yml</strong>: a configuration file that stores
connection information used to execute a study</li>
<li>
<strong>AnalysisScript.R</strong>: an organized R file that is used
to write a component of the analysis</li>
<li>
<strong>ExampleScript.R</strong>: an R file that is used to
reproduce an example for a study node</li>
<li>
<strong>Internals.R</strong>: an organized R file used to provide
structure to internal functions used in a study</li>
<li>
<strong>HowToRun.md</strong>: a markdown file the provides the
technical details and instructions for study execution</li>
<li>
<strong>CohortDetails.md</strong>: a markdown file used to track and
provide basic overview of cohorts used in the study</li>
<li>
<strong>KeyringSetup.R</strong>: an R file that provides keyring
setup, modified version of a strategus file</li>
<li>
<strong>StudyProtocol.Rmd</strong>: a file containing a template of
the study protocol, this also contains a folder of dependent files</li>
<li>
<strong>StudySynopsis.qmd</strong>: a quarto file containing a
template for a study synopsis, a lax version of the protocol</li>
<li>
<strong>ParticipationRequestEmail.txt</strong>: a simple file with a
pre-rendered email asking to participate in a study</li>
<li>
<strong>RepoRequestEmail.txt</strong>: a simple file with a
pre-rendered email asking the owner of ohdsi-studies to set up a
repo</li>
</ul>
<p>Some templates we would like to add include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forum post: a template for a forum post announcing the start of a
study</li>
<li>Contribution Guidelines: a file outlining how people can contribute
to the study</li>
<li>Strategus files: there are series of strategus files used in the SOS
challenge that can be pre-rendered</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cohort-organization">Cohort Organization<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cohort-organization"></a>
</h3>
<p>Cohort definitions are essential to an OHDSI study because it is how
we enumerate populations used for statistical methods or simple
summaries. The cohort definition in an OHDSI study is stored as a json
file. Strong organization and communication of the cohort definitions is
an important aspect when developing a study. <code>picard</code> aims to
provide support for keeping track of cohort definitions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Adding cohort json files</strong>: functionality to import
cohort definitions is an important part of a study. There are three ways
to add cohorts: importing existing json, pulling from OHDSI WebApi or
using Capr. <code>picard</code> provides functionality to handle these
different ways of adding cohort definitions</li>
<li>
<strong>Cohort Folders</strong>: providing directory organization to
cohort definitions makes it easier for users to find and review cohort
definitions. <code>picard</code> provides a function that adds a new
folder for cohort definitions, <code>makeCohortFolder</code>. The
cohortsToCreate folder comes initialized with a folder
<em>01_target</em> used to store the target cohort definition. Users can
add other types of cohorts such as comparator, outcome,
negative_control, strata, covariates. It is up to the user to provide
naming for different types of cohorts. For each new folder an integer is
added to the front of the file to provide order.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cohort Details</strong>: cohort definitions in json format
are difficult to read. Through our project work, we have found success
using a <code>CohortDetails.md</code> file that provides a simple
explanation of the cohort and track changes to the definition over time.
It is important to depict how cohort definitions have evolved over the
course of the study when developing within a study team.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cohort Manifest</strong>: Often when running a study we need
to keep tabs of the names of the cohorts that correspond to the ids
tacked to the definition within the cohort table. <code>picard</code>
provides a function called <code>cohortManifest</code> which looks into
the cohort folder and lists all the cohorts used in the study. This
tibble can be manipulated in all sorts of ways that are beneficial to
the development of the study.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="project-page">Project Page<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#project-page"></a>
</h3>
<p>A future feature we intend to add to the <code>picard</code> package
are functions that works similarly to <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">pkgdown</a> in building a website for
R packages. An OHDSI study page would be very useful in communicating
how to contribute, run and document the study.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="git-assistors">Git Assistors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git-assistors"></a>
</h3>
<p>Future features that would suit the <code>picard</code> package are
functions that help work with the OHDSI study on github or bitbucket.
Ideas for assistant functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>downloadStudy</strong>: download and open a study from a
repository</li>
<li>
<strong>initGit</strong>: initialize github (requires org
permission)</li>
<li>
<strong>postIssue</strong>: a template for an issue post for the
repository</li>
<li>
<strong>makeKanban</strong>: a function to initialize a kanban board
via github projects</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="results-dissimination">Results Dissimination<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#results-dissimination"></a>
</h3>
<p>Functionality that helps transfer results to study host. The <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/OhdsiSharing" class="external-link"><code>OhdsiSharing</code>
package</a> already exists for this, however there are times,
particularly in internal studies where study results need to be sent via
gdrive or dropbox. Functionality to borden the possibilities for sending
results would be helpful.</p>
<p>Another function would be to browse the results via a shiny app. This
would require sync with <code>ResultsModelManager</code> and
<code>ShinyAppBuilder</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="study-communication">Study Communication<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#study-communication"></a>
</h3>
<p>Often we need to communicate with our study nodes. This is done
either by email or the forums. A potential feature set could be
providing functionality to post to the OHDSI forums about your study or
send an email to participants notifying them of updates.</p>
